# WaveRNN
Pytorch implementation of Deepmind's WaveRNN model from [Efficient Neural Audio Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435v1)

**This is very much a work in progress**

Once the basic experiments are worked through in the notebooks, the entire repo will be refactored.


**Disclaimer**

I do not represent or work for Deepmind.
